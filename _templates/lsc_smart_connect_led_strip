## Warning

As of July 2020 this device comes with a Tuya WB3S module which cannot be flashed with Tasmota. The board version is named: WiFi-TYWE3L-2-V1.1
The Tuya WB3S module is pin compatible with ESP-12 and can ordered via Ebay. Replace the modul with a hot air gun and copy the actual Tasmota firmware in the ESP-12. All LEDs are usable R,G,B,CW,WW and you can dimm it.

In the new board version is the IR Receiver connected to GPIO03 as IRrecv. To activate the IR commands open the console and copy and paste the following lines an finish with Enter.

```console
Rule1 ON IrReceived#Data=0x00FFB04F DO power Toggle ENDON ON IrReceived#Data=0x00FFB847 DO dimmer - ENDON ON IrReceived#Data=0x00FF906F DO dimmer + ENDON ON IrReceived#Data=0x00FF9867 DO color 1 ENDON ON IrReceived#Data=0x00FFD827 DO color 2 ENDON ON IrReceived#Data=0x00FF8877 DO color 3 ENDON ON IrReceived#Data=0x00FFE817 DO color 4 ENDON ON IrReceived#Data=0x00FF48B7 DO color 5 ENDON ON IrReceived#Data=0x00FF6897 DO color 6 ENDON ON IrReceived#Data=0x00FF02FD DO color 7 ENDON ON IrReceived#Data=0x00FF32CD DO color 8 ENDON ON IrReceived#Data=0x00FF20DF DO color 9 ENDON ON IrReceived#Data=0x00FF50AF DO color 10 ENDON ON IrReceived#Data=0x00FF708F DO color 11 ENDON ON IrReceived#Data=0x00FFA857 DO color #000000FF00 ENDON ON IrReceived#Data=0x00FFB24D DO color #00000000FF ENDON ON IrReceived#Data=0x00FF00FF DO color + ENDON ON IrReceived#Data=0x00FF58A7 DO color - ENDON Rule1 1
```

The IR commands nearly complete:  

`Rule1`
`ON IrReceived#Data=0x00FFB04F DO power Toggle ENDON`
`ON IrReceived#Data=0x00FFB847 DO dimmer - ENDON`
